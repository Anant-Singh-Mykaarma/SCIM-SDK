 * additional right to a thing, object, or service. No vocabulary or syntax is specified; service providers
 * and clients are expected to encode sufficient information in the value so as to accurately and without
 * ambiguity determine what the user has access to. This value has no canonical types, although a type may be
 * useful as a means to scope entitlements.
